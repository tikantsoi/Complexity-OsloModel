# Complexity-OsloModel

This is a computer simulation of the Oslo model as part of the Complexity and Networks course in Imperial College Physics. This project aims to study self-organised criticality and scale-free behaviour of the Oslo model for a range of system sizes. Despite that the Oslo model was originally created to model experiments on a rice pile, the dynamical behaviour behind such system can be used to explain the origin of complexity in nature, on a broader scale, this includes avalanches and seismic events in geophysics, even stock market crashes.
